- 👋 Hi, I’m @prowindowsuser
- 👀 I’m interested in creating github issues with no effort & want help 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the population of the earth is outweighd by ants by a ratio of somewhere between
- 2.4 million to 1? That's right, all those tiny ants running around actually collectively weigh more than all the humans put together!
